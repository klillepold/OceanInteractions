Crona, B., Wassénius, E., Lillepold, K., Watson, R., Selig, E.R., Hicks, C., Österblom, H., Folke, C., Blasiak, R., Jouffray, J.B. (2020). Sharing the seas: A review and analysis of ocean sector interactions in the Anthropocene. Unpublished manuscript.


## Getting Started
The R scripts contained in this repository were used to create the figures found in Crona et al, unpublished.
Accompanying data used for figures 1-3 can be found at: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/SI6TUS

* **Figure1a.R** and **Figure1b.R** are the scripts used to create the networks found in Figure 1 of the manuscript.
* **Shiny app** is a folder containing the script used to create the R shiny interactive network tool, which can be explored here: https://gedb.shinyapps.io/OceanInteractions/
* **Figure2.R** is the script used to create the plots of bidirectional and unidirectional sector interactions by sector.
* **Figure3.R** TBD

* The **Supplementary** folder contains the scripts used to create figures shown in the Supplementary material of Crona et al: 
FigS3a.R and FigS3a.R are the scripts used to create Figure S3 in the supplementary material, showing the distribution of articles across sectors.
Fig S4_S7.R is the script used to create both figures S4 and S7 in the supplementary material, showing the appearance of sectors and mediators over time in the reviewed literature.
