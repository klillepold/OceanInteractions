## Getting Started
The R scripts contained in this repository highlight the different steps taken to create the figures found in Crona et al, unpublished.
Accompanying data can be found at: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/SI6TUS

 
 
* **Figure1a.R** and **Figure1b** are the scripts used to create the networks found in Figure 1 of the manuscript.
* **Shiny app** is a folder containing the script used to create the interactive network tool, which can be explored here: https://gedb.shinyapps.io/OceanInteractions/
* **Figure2.R** is the script used to create the plots of bidirectional and unidirectional sector interactions.
* **Figure3.R** TBD.
* **Supplementary** contains the scripts used to create figures shown in the Supplementary material of Crona et al.
